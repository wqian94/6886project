Cache Efficiency in Parallel Ordinary and Partial Differential Equation Solvers
---

MIT 6.886 project, Spring 2020.

This codebase contains basic parallel Runge-Kutta implementations and an
n-dimensional Peano grid workload generator, tested to be correct up to 3
dimensions, but should in theory be correct for any number of dimensions.
